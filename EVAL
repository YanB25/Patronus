# Motivation
- The latency of each permission modification algorithms
    - QP recreate, MR rereg, MW
- The overhead of QP recovery.

# Microbench
- Latency and throughput of get_[rw]lease
- The scalability of lease (# of active leases)
- the overhead of QP recovery and the backup QP in reaction to the recovery (time graph)
- Sensitivity analysis 
    - of lease term: should be okay even lower to us-scale.
- The overhead of unbind (a comparison)
- Performance boost with registering MR each time. Register one time as the theoretical performance bound.
- The overhead of tree-liked time-sync algorithm. See how fast it converges.
- Allocation with MR .v.s allocation with MW.
- [may] Report the "lease unexpected expire" times.
- [may] The converge of Tree based time sync?
- [may] Report the data path latency. KRCore can report its datapath latency (which is trivial), so do I. 

# Macrobench
- The shrinking problem of RACE hashing.
    - Original hash table does not support memory isolation. Thus shrinking may cause serious problem. The gap between read and CAS can always corrupt the memory.
    - Patronus way: lease (amortize the overhead of querying) + backup QP (hide the QP recovery overhead) + MW (quick permission change)
    - Not open-sourced. Should impl it on my own.
    - The extender (or shrinker) acquires for a lease, instead of locking with CAS. Then, if the CN thread failed, other threads can help.
    - The permission to the KV pool could also use lease.
    - Report:
        - a) close all the RDMA connections case
        - b) rereg MR works, but will not report, because the motivation already rules out this.
        - c) Do nothing: the theoretical performance bound
        - d) Patronus management subtable allocations and deallocation.
        - report the 1) regular performance, 2) shrink will not lower performance 3) expending is on the critical path, so report the expending latency!
- Or CoRM, because it is open-sourced
- From AIFM to AIFM-Patronus
    - AIFM reports a 0.3 Mops for its syncthetic workload. Should be far enough for Patronus
    - remoteable SPSC dynamic queue 
        - Argue that AIFM does not and can not consider the multiple CN situations. Because when the queue expends the producer will access invalid memory.
        - We impl a simple SPSC queue, which support expanding: use Patronus to revoke the access permission on the old small memory.
    - AIFM's vector expending and shrinking, should be a good case.
- workload for remote memory I. Showing that Patronus will not lower down perofrmance
    - Workload of graph-analytics, inception, quicksort, in-memory-analytics, kmeans, xsbench
    - The performance ratio of Patronus and register MR. The performance of Patronus v.s. FastSwap
    - Varing local memory ratio
    - ArXiv hardware-assisted trusted memory disaggregation for secure far memory. Figure 18.
- [may] The performance of KV (So... what's the purpose of this experiment?)
    - The index is accessible by anyone (because too fine-granularity for Patronus to offer high performance), or the privilige index thread (delegated)
    - The actual KV pairs are accessed by worker threads, guarded by Patronus.
    - Maybe a hand-writing one, maybe the passive KV on disaggregated memory.
        - for Passive KV, the 4CN+4DN/8threads setting with YCSB A(50/50 R/W) gets only 5Mops. I think Patronus is able to reach that.
    - So I can compare in this way. a) MN do the index searching + write, b) client do indexing searching, grant lease then write. c) totally one-sided.
- [may] Compare with FaRM. Does it make sense to compare FaRM?
    - Not open-sourced, should emulate it.

# TODO
[-] Find any serverless or container frameworks based on DM and C++: All the serverless platform is based on GoLang, which can not link with C++.
- Is FastSwap, Infiniswap, AIFM crash tolerance?
[-] HOW CoRM compares to FaRM: FaRM is not open-sourced, so CoRW emulated FaRM (including its cacheline consistency check) following the publicly available information.
    - CoRM use the same consistency checking algorithm (per-cacheline version), so it compares to FaRM.

# Some Results
Register MR: 50us for 4KB from KRCore
QP memory overhead: 292 sq, 257 comp_queue entries, sq entry takes 448B, cq takes 4 B. Each RCQP takes 159KB.

## bench_allocator
Memory Window binding:
* Every request signal (no batching): 
1.18 Mops per thread
up to 19 Mops with 31 threads
* Every request signal (no batching, 8 coroutines):
2.56 Mops per thread
up to 26 Mops with 16 threads (I think RNIC bounded)

## bench_patronus_alloc
One patronus->get_rlease() requires two binding: one for PR and one for buffer.

* patronus->get_rlease(kDebugNoBindAny):
2.13 Mops per thread with 16 coroutines
up to 25.5 Mops with 16 threads

* patronus->get_rlease(kDebugNoBindPr):
1.42 Mops per thread with 16 coroutines
up to 17.8 Mops with 16 threads

* patronus->get_rlease():
1.32 Mops per thread with 16 coroutines
up to 9.1 Mops with 8 threads

* patronus->get_rlease(kTypeAlloc)
1.2 Mops per thread with 16 coroutines 
up to 14.9 Mops with 16 threads

* patronus->get_rlease(kTypeAlloc | kRelinquishNoUnbind)
1.5 Mops per thread with 16 coroutines
up to 17. Mops with 16 threads

# patronus->get_rlease(kTypeAlloc)

I guess it is switching to rmsg bounded now. 
TODO: Still not perfect results.
- Expect: patronus->get_rlease(kDebugNoBindPr) can be close to bench_allocator reports (i.e. 26 Mops)
- Expect: patronus->get_rlease() can be half of bench_allocator reports (i.e. 13 Mops)

# Racehashing

## ReadOnly

The data is preliminary, may get better later.
Thread = 8, Coco = 16, RO, RH<4, 16, 16>
Got 4.3 Mops.
