TODO:
[-] Add API p->should_exit()
[-] Add key_to_dsm_addr API for addressing.
- Implemente all the APIs in Patronus
- Bench the performance / coroutine.

[-] when QP fails, before recovery, we should wait for all the on-going contexts, and set result to false.
[-] then, we should return all the onging coro ids. so that, the client_master will yield to these coroutines
[-] then, all the worker will realize that they fail. so they all retries.
[-] refactor: the API for client should combine into one.

- implement relinquish, and let the server gc the memory window. so that I can bench for a looong time instead of several ms.
- try to optimize the performance of single-thread patronus-basic (takes 2-3 days if lucky).
- remember to measure the latency of each op, and the penalty of coroutine switching.
